# Asynchronous-FIFO
# This project implements an Asynchronous FIFO (First-In-First-Out) memory module with the following specifications:
Depth: 8 entries 
Word Length: 8 bits
The FIFO is designed to handle data transfer between two clock domains efficiently, ensuring reliable communication between modules operating at different clock frequencies.
