# Asynchronous-FIFO
This project implements an Asynchronous FIFO (First-In-First-Out) memory module with the following specifications:</br>
Depth: 8 entries </br>
Word Length: 8 bits</br>
The FIFO is designed to handle data transfer between two clock domains efficiently, ensuring reliable communication between modules operating at different clock frequencies.</br>
